# WCS-Abandon-Picks
WorkSheet To Abandon Picks from IE.

Uses a worksheet to get Articles and to get reason for abandoning.

1. Gets userName, password then checks if match.
2. Performs actions and informs user whats have been done.

Can be made a bit simplier using URL GET but done it this way as I wanted to learn how to attach to IE and get/find elements by ID,ClassName, TAGname.
